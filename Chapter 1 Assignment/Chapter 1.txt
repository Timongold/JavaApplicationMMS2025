1.7 Explain the two compilation phases of Java programs. 
Answer
1. Compilation Phase:
The Java source file (.java) is compiled using the javac compiler. During this phase, the compiler checks for syntax and type errors and translates the source code into bytecode. The output is a .class file containing platform-independent bytecode.
2. Execution Phase:
The .class file is executed using the java command. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) loads the bytecode, verifies it for security, and translates it into machine code for the specific computer. The program is then executed.
This two-phase process allows Java programs to be platform-independent.

1.8 One of the world’s most common objects is a wrist watch. Discuss how each of the following terms and concepts applies to the notion of a watch: object, attributes, behaviors, class, inheritance (consider, for example, an alarm clock), modeling, messages, encapsulation, interface and information hiding.
Answer
Here is a clear and concise explanation using a wristwatch as an example:
Object
A wristwatch is an object because it is a real-world entity with characteristics and behaviors.
Attributes
Attributes are the properties of the watch, such as:
•	Time displayed
•	Brand
•	Color
•	Size
•	Battery level
Behaviors
Behaviors are the actions the watch can perform, such as:
•	Displaying time
•	Setting the time
•	Setting an alarm
•	Starting a stopwatch
•	Turning on a light
Class
A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
For example, Watch is a class, and a specific watch (e.g., your black Casio wristwatch) is an object created from that class.
Inheritance
Inheritance allows a new class to acquire the features of an existing class.
For example:
•	A SmartWatch or AlarmClock can inherit from the Watch class.
•	It keeps basic time features but adds new features like notifications or louder alarms.
Modeling
Modeling is creating a simplified representation of a real-world object.
In programming, we model a watch by defining its attributes (time, brand) and behaviors (setTime(), setAlarm()).
Messages
Messages are requests sent to an object to perform an action.
For example:
•	Pressing a button sends a message like setTime().
•	Pressing “start” sends a message like startStopwatch().
Encapsulation
Encapsulation means combining data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) into one unit.
The watch stores time internally and provides buttons (methods) to modify it.
Interface
The interface is how users interact with the watch.
For example:
•	Buttons
•	Touch screen
•	Display screen
It shows what the watch can do without exposing how it works internally.
Information Hiding
Information hiding means the internal working mechanism (gears, circuits, programming logic) is hidden from the user.
Users only interact through the interface and do not need to know how the watch calculates time.


Making a Difference
1.9 (Test-Drive: Carbon Footprint Calculator) 
Some scientists believe that carbon emissions, especially from the burning of fossil fuels, contribute significantly to global warming and that this can be combatted if individuals take steps to limit their use of carbon-based fuels. Organizations and individuals are increasingly concerned about their “carbon footprints.” Websites such as TerraPass http://www.terrapass.com/carbon-footprint-calculator/ and Carbon Footprint http://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx provide carbon-footprint calculators. Test-drive these calculators to determine your carbon footprint. Exercises in later chapters will ask you to program your own carbon-footprint calculator. To prepare for this, use the web to research the formulas for calculating carbon footprints. 

1.10 (Test-Drive: Body Mass Index Calculator) 
Obesity causes significant increases in illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease. To determine whether a person is overweight or obese, you can use a measure called the body mass index (BMI). The United States Department of Health and Human Services provides a BMI calculator at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/BMI/ bmicalc.htm. Use it to calculate your own BMI. A forthcoming exercise will ask you to program your own BMI calculator. To prepare for this, use the web to research the formulas for calculating BMI. 

1.11 (Attributes of Hybrid Vehicles) 
Hybrid vehicles are becoming increasingly popular, because they often get much better mileage than purely gasoline-powered vehicles. Browse the web and study the features of four or five of today’s popular hybrid cars, then list as many of their hybrid-related attributes as you can. Some common attributes include city-miles-per-gallon and highway-miles-per-gallon. Also list the attributes of the batteries (type, weight, etc.). 

1.12 (Gender Neutrality) 
Many people want to eliminate sexism in all forms of communication. You’ve been asked to create a program that can process a paragraph of text and replace gender-specific words with gender-neutral ones. Assuming that you’ve been given a list of gender-specific words and their gender-neutral replacements (e.g., replace both “wife” and “husband” with “spouse,” “man” and “woman” with “person,” “daughter” and “son” with “child”), explain the procedure you’d use to read through a paragraph of text and manually perform these replacements. How might your procedure generate a strange term like “woperchild?” You’ll soon learn that a more formal term for “procedure” is “algorithm,” and that an algorithm specifies the steps to be performed and the order in which to perform them. We’ll show how to develop algorithms then convert them to Java programs which can be run on computers.
